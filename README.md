### <a name="_8vjhr7bl6gdz"></a>**Game Overview:**
"Feline Frenzy" is a strategic action-puzzle game set in a cozy café, where players control three distinct cat characters, each with unique abilities. The café’s owner is distressed by a rat that has been raiding the food stash. Sparky, the black cat, recently received a laser vest as a gift, and after discovering it can disable electronics, he realizes he can use it to help catch the rat. Rallying his lazy but food-motivated friend Snowball (the white cat) and mischievous Ginger, the trio sets off on a mission to protect their turf. The goal is to navigate through each room, disable traps, and reach the rat before it escapes.

### **Backstory:**
Sparky the black cat is fiercely loyal to his owner and always curious about the world around him. Lately, the café they call home has been overrun by a pesky rat, sneaking food and causing frustration for Sparky’s owner. One day, Sparky’s persistent meowing catches his owner’s attention, but his owner assumes he’s just bored. As a playful distraction, the owner gives Sparky a new laser toy, attaching it to his harness.

Excited by his new toy, Sparky chases the laser around the café, pouncing and playing. During his playful antics, he accidentally aims the laser at the café’s Roomba, which suddenly makes a loud noise and halts in its tracks. The sound startles a hidden rat, who scurries out from behind a counter, making a dash toward its hiding spot. Realizing this could be his chance to finally catch the food thief, Sparky springs into action.

Knowing he’ll need some help to outsmart the crafty rat, Sparky runs to find his housemates, Ginger and Snowball. First, he convinces Ginger, the mischievous orange cat, by promising that the chase will be filled with thrilling excitement and the chance to knock over a few plants along the way. Then he approaches Snowball, the food-loving white cat, warning him that the rat has been stealing their precious food supplies. With visions of tasty treats at stake, Snowball reluctantly agrees to join the mission.

Now united, the three cats embark on their adventure, each bringing unique skills to the hunt. With the clock ticking and the rat escaping further into the café, they must work together to track down and capture the elusive intruder before it finds a safe hiding spot once again.
